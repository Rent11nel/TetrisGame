# TetrisGame

Tetris is a computer game, invented by Alexey Pajitnov in the USSR, and released on June 6, 1984.

The gameplay of Tetris involves falling random tetromino shapes into a rectangular playfield, which is 10 cells wide and 20 cells high. 
While in mid-air, the player can rotate the tetromino by 90 degrees and move it horizontally. The player also has the option to "drop" the tetromino 
when they have decided on its final position. The tetromino continues to fall until it either lands on the bottom of the playfield or on top of another tetromino. 
If a horizontal line of 10 cells is completely filled, it disappears, and any blocks above it shift down by one cell.

The size will not exceed 265 program lines.
